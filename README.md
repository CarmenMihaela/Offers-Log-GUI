# Offers-Log-GUI
A GUI I made using tkinter, sqlite and matplotlib
The GUI has 3 tabs: first is an interface where the user enters the offers they are working on. The second tab is the manual of using the whole app, and the third tab produces a table and some charts based on the data inputed in tab 1.
